[![Github Actions Status](https://github.com/KsRyY/bethlehem/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/KsRyY/bethlehem/actions)

Bethlehem is a minimal functional programming library for JavaScript. It is inspired by [Ramda](https://github.com/ramda/ramda) but has some significant differences.

## Document :construction:

Not avaliable yet, but the source code is kinda self-explanatory.

## Development

```bash
yarn watch
# or npm
npm run watch
```

This will run the [ava](http://ava.li) in watch mode. Test suite will be rerun if there's any change in `src` or in the test file.

```bash
yarn build
# or npm
npm run build
```

This will build all source code and put them in the `dist` folder. Declarations will be also built.
